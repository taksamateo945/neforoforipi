Using the metric system, that figure converts to 185 cm or 1.85 m.</strong></p><p>The Downingtown, Pennsylvania-born American actor, who has been active in Hollywood since the early 2000s, recently attracted the attention of the public with his starring performance as Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw in the hit 2022 movie Top Gun: Maverick. The handsome actor’s physical features have seen him handed some important acting roles, and part of those physical features includes his impressive height.</p><h3><strong>Miles Teller’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>AGE:</strong> 36 Years Old</li><li><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> February 20, 1987</li><li><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States</li><li><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Pisces</li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> Caucasian, Part Jewish</li><li><strong>FATHER:</strong> Michael Teller</li><li><strong>MOTHER:</strong> Merry Teller</li><li><strong>SIBLINGS:</strong> Erin Teller (sister), Dana Teller (sister)</li><li><strong>MILES TELLER’S HEIGHT IN INCHES:</strong> 6 feet 1 inch</li><li><strong>MILES TELLER’S HEIGHT IN CENTIMETERS:</strong> 185 cm (1.85m)</li><li><strong>MILES TELLER’S WEIGHT:</strong> 79 kg (174 lbs)</li><li><strong>BODY MEASUREMENTS IN INCHES:</strong> 39-14-34 (chest-biceps-waist)</li><li><strong>BODY MEASUREMENTS IN CENTIMETERS:</strong> 99-36-86 (chest-biceps-waist)</li><li><strong>HAIR COLOR:</strong> Dark Brown</li><li><strong>DARK BROWN:</strong> Dark Brown</li></ul><h2><strong>Miles Teller’s Height is Above the Average American Actor</strong></h2><p>At 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm or 1.85 m), Miles Teller significantly towers above the average American actor, who several sources estimate to stand at around 5 feet 9 inches tall. It’s the same when we compare the actor’s height to that of the average American male, who also stands at 5 feet 9 inches.</p><p>The aforementioned statistic confirms that the 36-year-old actor is at least four inches taller than his average colleague and is among a select few actors in the industry whose height advantage has played an integral role in advancing his career as an actor.</p><h2><strong>Miles Teller’s Height Compared to His Co-Actors on Top Gun: Maverick</strong></h2><p>Miles Teller’s acting career has seen him appear in several movies, including the 2013 coming-of-age film The Spectacular Now, the Divergent trilogy (2014 -2016), Whiplash (2014), Fantastic Four (2015), and War Dogs (2016), among several others.</p><p>His relatively well-established career received a further boost after he was cast in the starring role of Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw in the 2022 American action drama film Top Gun: Maverick.</p><p>Teller’s role in the sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun saw him pitted alongside several other talented actors such as Val Kilmer, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, and the multiple award-winning actor Tom Cruise.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/top_gun_maverick_cast-premiere_london-1.jpg alt="Miles Teller Height" width=696 height=516 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>A few articles have been written to compare and contrast several aspects of the lives of the actors and actresses involved in that blockbuster, including their acting styles and physical characteristics such as their heights and body measurements.</p><p>Take a quick look at how Miles Teller’s height compares to some of the actors who shared screen time with him in Top Gun: Maverick.</p><h3><strong>Miles Teller’s Height vs. Val Kilmer’s Height</strong></h3><p>Reprising his role as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky in the movie, 63-year-old veteran actor Val Edward Kilmer (born December 31, 1959) is reportedly 5 feet 11½ inches (182 centimeters or 1.82 meters) tall.</p><p>That figure means Miles Teller is around one and a half inches taller than the Top Secret star. Kilmer, who began his acting career in 1981, played a bit-part role in the movie, and Teller has spoken of how much he enjoyed working with the crew and cast of the action drama film, including Kilmer.</p><h3><strong>How Tall is Miles Teller Compared to Jon Hamm?</strong></h3><p>Born Jonathan Daniel Hamm on March 10, 1971, Jon Hamm played the role of Naval Air Forces commander Vice Admiral Beau “Cyclone” Simpson in Top Gun: Maverick&nbsp;and is one of the actors who shared screen time with Teller.</p><p>There is a significant age difference of nearly two decades between the co-stars, but in terms of height, there is not much to separate them as Teller’s 6 feet 1 inch is only marginally higher than Hamm’s 6 feet ¾ inches (184 cm or 1.84 m).</p><h3><strong>Miles Teller’s Height Compared to Glen Powell</strong></h3><p>Glen Powell was born on October 21, 1988, a birth statistic that means that he is a year and a few months younger than Teller.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/top_gun_maverick_cast-premiere_london-1.jpg><p>The Divergent actor’s relative superiority over his co-star extends to their height difference, albeit not too significantly, in the sense that his 6 feet 1-inch frame slightly betters Powell’s 5 feet 111/4 inches (181 cm or 1.81 m).</p><p>For emphasis, Powell plays the role of LT Jake “Hangman” Seresin, a F/A- 18E pilot and mission candidate in Top Gun: Maverick. His IMDb page indicates that he has well over two dozen TV series and film credits to his name since he became active in Hollywood in 2003.</p><h3><strong>Miles Teller’s Height vs. </strong><strong>Lewis Pullman’s Height</strong></h3><p>It has become increasingly evident that Miles Teller is taller than almost all his fellow male co-stars in Top Gun: Maverick, a statistic that Lewis Pullman’s height of 5 feet 11½ inches (182 cm 0r 1.82 m) further emphasizes.</p><p>That stat confirms the widely held view that Miles Teller, who stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm or 1.85 m), is at least one and a half inches taller than his co-star who plays the role of LT Robert “Bob” Floyd in the action drama film.</p><h3><strong>How Tall is Miles Teller Compared to Tom Cruise?</strong></h3><p>Tom Cruise is arguably the biggest star name on the list of actors to play a part in Top Gun: Maverick after reprising his role as Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in the blockbuster. However, his acting skills make up for his rather diminutive 5 feet 7¾ inches (172 cm or 1.72 m) height.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/Top-Gun-Maverick-Stars-Detai-1-1024x1024.jpg><p>The stark contrast between his height and Teller’s becomes even more evident when they are standing next to each other as Teller’s extra five inches becomes apparent to anyone who bothers to look.</p><h2><strong>Miles Teller’s Weight Provides a Nice Balance to His Height</strong></h2><p>Teller’s 79 kg (174 lbs) weight provides a perceptibly perfect balance to his 6 feet 1-inch frame. However, certain reports claim that the actor weighed significantly more (around 85 kg or 188 bs) in 2016 before being cast in&nbsp;Bleed For This.</p><p>His involvement in that production required him to embark on a weight loss regimen that resulted in his current weight measurement. He also had to go through the same process that got him in shape for that role for his role in Top Gun: Maverick.</p><p>Other aspects of the Pennsylvania-born actor’s measurements are 39-14-34 inches (99-36-86 centimeters) being measured for his chest, biceps, and waist, respectively.</p><p>Teller’s hair color is dark brown, and he has the same eyes color as his hair. There is also a distinctive scar on the actor’s face, a souvenir from a ghastly car accident he was involved in, in 2007.</p><h2><strong>Miles Teller’s Workout Regimen Involves Some Pretty Hardcore Exercises</strong></h2><p>As previously mentioned, anyone who saw Miles Teller before his roles in the movies Bleed For This and Top Gun: Maverick will know that the actor had to metaphorically go through hell to achieve his currently ripped physique.</p><p>One source claimed that the actor trained with Darrell Foster and nutritionist Gary Kobat to achieve his body goals. He was made to give up alcohol and cheap meals, including junk food for five straight months. He reportedly ran five miles a day and engaged in cardio-vascular exercises like boxing.</p><p>It is unclear whether he still works with the aforementioned duo. However, one look at the movie star will tell the beholder that he is still actively engaged in exercise routines that ensure that he stays in top physical condition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqquMSsZK2dnKGys3nHnqCgoKRitbDDjK2YpaRdnsButMRmpaivXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmiles-teller-height-how-tall-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmiles-teller-height-how-tall-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmiles-teller-height-how-tall-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmiles-teller-height-how-tall-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmiles-teller-height-how-tall-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmiles-teller-height-how-tall-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./golf-pimped-cart-hummer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./golf-pimped-cart-hummer.html>'Pimp my golf cart' - CNN.com</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./direction-in-fashion-html.html>Direction in fashion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./direction-in-fashion-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
