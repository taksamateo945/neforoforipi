<time>28 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2><span id=Who_is_Chloe_Schnapp>Who is Chloe Schnapp?</span></h2><p>American social media star and YouTuber Chloe Schnapp was born under the zodiac sign Libra on 3 October 2004, in Scarsdale, New York State USA. She’s active on various social media networks, and launched her YouTube channel on 4 July 2021, which is today subscribed to by close to 2,000 people; Chloe’s posted 25 videos and all of these together number more than 130,000 views. Most of Chloe’s videos feature her spending time with her family, singing karaoke, and taking on some of the most popular internet challenges.</p><p>She’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>also known for</a> being the twin sister of Noah Schnapp, a popular American actor ,perhaps known best for starring as Will Byers in all 41 episodes of the critically acclaimed fantasy horror series “Stranger Things”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/7a1a614e33223bfdda3c619ad3045ebc.jpg><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Chloe was raised in Scarsdale alongside Noah, by their father Mitchell Schnapp and mother Karine (nee Perez); the family’s Jewish and Chloe and Noah travelled to Israel to have their bar mitzvah. Karine’s of Moroccan descent and works at Hugo Boss as the president of marketing, and Mitchell’s of Russian descent and is a private equity manager.</p><p>Chloe studied at a local high school together with her brother and when he joined the school’s drama club, she followed in his footsteps; she was eight when her brother was advised by his teacher to pursue a career as an actor, and even though Chloe wanted to try it as well, she soon learned that she wasn’t talented enough. She remained supportive of her brother and encouraged him to go to auditions.</p><p>Chloe instead <a rel=nofollow href=#>focused on dancing</a>, and went on to take lessons for a couple of years. She’s matriculated just recently in 2023, and because she’s yet to talk about her further education, it’s widely believed that Chloe’s chosen not to attend college.</p><h2><span id=Most_viewed_YouTube_videos>Most viewed YouTube videos</span></h2><p>Chloe seems to be mostly popular on YouTube for the short videos in which she can be seen spending time with her brother Noah, although her fans also like her for taking on internet challenges, her dance moves and pretty face.
