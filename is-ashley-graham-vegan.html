<time>27 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Other plus-size celebs like Adele have credited a vegan diet for keeping them in shape and assisting in mass weight-loss. Is the world’s most famous plus-size model, Ashley Graham, a vegan?</p><p><strong>Ashley Graham is not vegan. The supermodel does eat meat although she has told multiple news outlets that she tries to not eat meat until the evening. Her diets include eating a lot of healthy vegetables and when she eats off her diet, she always does it in moderation. Her one staple when it comes to food is green juice.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_384073006-683x1024.jpg><p>You can read more below about what Ashley Graham likes to eat, her diet staples, and some of her fitness routines.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ashley Graham’s Diet</h2><p>When people see the word diet, it’s pretty common for the alarm bells to go off and judgemental behavior to pop up. That’s because there is this widespread thought that the word diet is synonymous with the words “weight-loss.”</p><p>In reality, diet really just refers to what you eat whether it be an “I eat whatever I want to diet” to an “I’m on a raw vegan diet” to “I only eat meat.” In the case of Ashely Graham, she would probably go with the idea of being on a balanced and healthy diet.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Stylecaster</a>, Graham gave them the dish on what she likes to eat as a part of her healthy diet. And, it really is just that- a healthy diet.&nbsp;</p><p>She told interviewer Jasmine Garnsworthy that her go-to healthy drink is the “Green Giant” drink from Juice Press. On top of that, she actually went over what she had eaten so far that day.&nbsp;</p><p>Ashley Graham said that for her breakfast she had a green smoothie consisting of kale, lemon, ginger, beets, apple, and parsley. For her lunch, she ate a quinoa and brown rice bowl, and that her dinner was baked salmon with arugula salad and sweet potato.</p><p>Garnsworthy even asked the supermodel what the one thing was that she would never eat. Her response was “Never say never. I’ll try anything.”</p><p>One thing that Graham has really been adamant about is her portion control. She would rather eat what she wants and enjoy her food in smaller portions than have to cut all of the yummy stuff out.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Ashley Graham talk with Entertainment Tonight about her relationship with food in the below video.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Graham’s Guilty Pleasures</h2><p>Like all of us, Ashley Graham has guilty pleasures when it comes to food. One of her biggest guilty pleasures would have to pizza.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Huffington Post</a>’s Jamie Feldman, Ashley Graham admitted to the one thing that she would go “fat girl” for. Her response was “I do love my green juice and veggies… but I will also literally go fat girl on a big pizza-pie and then take the crust and dip it in Nutella.”</p><p>Apparently, this is the pizza hack that everyone wanted but no one knew about.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of her other guilty pleasures in the food realm are mac and cheese and ice cream. Even when she ate out with Christa D’Souza for her <a href=# rel=noopener>British Vogue</a> cover article in 2017, Graham joked about the size of the tiny bruschetta pieces that arrived at their table as an appetizer.&nbsp;</p><p>She said to D’Souza “God, I wonder what my pizza’s going to look like?”&nbsp;</p><p>Graham elaborates to her interviewer saying “But I’m very aware of portion control, and I’m also aware of why I choose to eat certain foods. I ask myself, ‘Am I eating this because I’m actually hungry or is this food some kind of reward?’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ashley Graham’s Fitness Routine</h2><p>One of the reason’s behind Ashley Graham’s ability to get away with her guilty pleasures is the fact that her <a href=# rel=noopener>fitness routine</a> is on point. She puts a lot of emphasis on making sure that she is very active throughout her week.&nbsp;</p><p>She works out at least three times a week and says that her favorite workout is kickboxing. She is also a huge fan of High-Intensity Interval Training also called H.I.I.T.&nbsp;</p><p>These two styles of workouts really cause the body to work up a sweat so Graham clearly likes to get her sweat on. One other activity that she enjoys is yoga, having even tried out aerial yoga while visiting New York.</p><p>So Ashley Graham isn’t a vegan but she really does know how to balance her life with healthy foods and fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZpmjnbmmxYygqZqgkaJ6t7HGmqVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-ashley-graham-vegan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-ashley-graham-vegan.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-ashley-graham-vegan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-ashley-graham-vegan.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-ashley-graham-vegan.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-ashley-graham-vegan.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./p-valley-season-3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./p-valley-season-3.html>P-Valley Season 3: Everything You Need to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./obituary-kara-teel.html>Obituary Kara Teel: 18, of Centralia has passed away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./obituary-kara-teel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
