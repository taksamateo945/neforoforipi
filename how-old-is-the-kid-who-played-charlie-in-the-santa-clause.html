Scott Calvin is a divorced <b>38-year-old</b> advertising executive, who is also a father to his son Charlie. Charlie’s mother, Laura, is now married to psychiatrist Neil Miller.</p><p>Did Judge Reinhold retire?</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Judge Reinhold</th></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>Edward Ernest Reinhold Jr. May 21, 1957 Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Mary Washington Palm Beach State College University of North Carolina School of the Arts (BFA)</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Years active</td><td>1979–present</td></tr></tbody></table><p>in the same way, Why is Bernard not in The Santa Clause 3? David Krumholtz Didn’t Appear in ‘Santa Clause 3’ <b>Because His Character Was “Devalued a Little Bit” in the Script</b>. The actor, who played fan-favorite head elf Bernard, clarifies that it wasn’t scheduling that kept him from appearing in the third installment of the Tim Allen-led Christmas franchise.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Scott_Calvin%E2%80%99s_job_at_the_beginning_of_the_movie></span>What is Scott Calvin’s job at the beginning of the movie?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Background. Originally, Scott Calvin was <b>an advertising executive for a toy company</b>. At the time of the first film, he is divorced from his ex-wife, Laura, with whom he had one son Charlie. He was initially cynical in regards to Christmas, but was willing to reassure his son about his belief.</p><p>Who plays Scott? The first film in the Santa Clause film series, it stars <b>Tim Allen</b> as Scott Calvin, an ordinary man who accidentally causes Santa Claus (played by Tim Allen’s actual stunt double, Steve Lucescu) to fall from his roof on Christmas Eve.</p><p>What magical object did Bernard give Charlie? Though Scott immediately denies this, Bernard explains that Scott will have until Thanksgiving to get his affairs in order before returning to become Santa full-time. Bernard also bonds with Charlie, giving him <b>a snow globe</b> (while also calling him “sport” as Scott does).</p><p>How old is Judge Reinhold now? Reinhold is <b>63 years old</b> as of 2020, he was born on May 21, 1957, in Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Bernard_the_elf_so_tall></span>Why is Bernard the elf so tall?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While most of the elves were played by children, Bernard’s actor, David Krumholtz, was 16 years old during filming, making <b>him noticeably taller and older</b>. In addition, Bernard is not as cheerful as the other elves, instead acting gruff and strict toward Scott as he explains the “Santa Clause” to him.</p><p>What does Elf stand for in The Santa Clause? A weird police report. Speaking of those elves with jetpacks, they’re known as E.L.F.S. (<b>Effective Liberating Flight Squad</b>), and they’re called into service when Santa is arrested after attempting to do his Santa thing at Laura and Neil’s house.</p><p>Why is Bernard the only tall elf?</p><p>While they have the appearance of small children, Bernard looks like he’s in his teenage years and <b>is much taller</b>. This could be because he’s not a full Elf and only stayed on the North Pole; he’s aging at a slower rate but still much older than the average child.</p><p>Who was The Santa Clause before Scott Calvin? <b>Peter Boyle</b> Was Recast</p><p>Peter Boyle, who is most probably known for his role as Frank on Everybody Love Raymond, also starred in the first Santa Clause movie as Scott’s boss. The actor did go on to appear in the other two movies, but was recast as Father Time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_owns_Santa_Claus></span>Who owns Santa Claus?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Santa Claus is a case in point. <b>Father Christmas, a British company</b> and owner of Santa-Claus.com, owns a trademark for “Santa Claus.” Trademark experts say that “Santa Claus” has become part of the public domain and that the trademark probably would not pass muster in a legal challenge.</p><p>What happened to the Santa who fell off the roof?</p><p>The Santa Clause</p><p>Later that night, Scott awakens to a sound on his roof. … <b>Scott’s shouting startles Santa into falling off to his death</b>, presumably killing him.</p><p>Where was Santa who filmed? However, this does make sense at the same time, because the movie was filmed in <b>Toronto, Canada</b>.</p><p>Why is Bernard bigger than the other elves? While they have the appearance of small children, Bernard looks like he’s in his teenage years and <b>is much taller</b>. This could be because he’s not a full Elf and only stayed on the North Pole; he’s aging at a slower rate but still much older than the average child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Bernard_the_elf></span>How old is Bernard the elf?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the aftermath of this discovery, he understandably had some mixed feelings about it all. Because while Bernard may have been hundreds of years old, Krumholtz was not. At the time, he was just <b>16 years old</b>. “It was a little weird, like I felt slightly violated.</p><p>Is Judge Reinhold his real name? <b>Edward Ernest Reinhold Jr.</b></p><p>How rich is Sean Penn?</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><th><b>$70 Million</b></th></tr><tr><td>Born:</td><td>August 17, 1960</td></tr><tr><td>Country of Origin:</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Source of Wealth:</td><td>Professional Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Last Updated:</td><td>2021</td></tr></tbody></table><p>• Dec 3, 2021</p><p>What toy does Buddy the Elf not like?

That’s right, Kris Kringle has a direct line: <b>(951) 262-3062</b>. Obviously this time of year keeps Santa busy in his workshop, so don’t be shocked when it goes right to voicemail.
