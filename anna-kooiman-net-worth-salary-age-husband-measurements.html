Her parents, Wally and Susan, still live in Charlotte, where she grew up, and are of Dutch ancestry. This means her son, Brooks, has one rich cultural background. Even though she currently lives in Sydney, Australia, we can always trace her roots back to the USA while working on Network Ten.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Anna Kooiman got her education at Myers Park High School and went on to study journalism at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Her career began in college while working part-time for Fox Sports. Her graduation marked the beginning of her journalism career at WWAY in 2005.</p><p>Her competence in her work got her anchoring for Fox News Rising, Fox & Friends, and many more News Segments. One of her most famous shows was Roadtrip with Anna Kooiman. However, she left it all to start a life with her husband, originally from Australia, when she moved in 2016.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Summary></span><strong>Summary.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It was a pleasure having Anna Kooiman on Fox. However, Australia seemed like a better deal offering her a higher salary amounting to a higher net worth figure.
