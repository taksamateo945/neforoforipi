It’s quite a surreal story and I loved the imagery of it. I kind of wanted something that wasn’t too literal and could throw up some sort of curious/abstract narrative. I guess the primary&nbsp;colours&nbsp;and black lines of a traditional Harlequin jester are slightly at odds with the gothic 60s cartoon art of&nbsp;Harlequiin. But that’s why I like it. And I added the extra ‘i’ because I like it visually –</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>and it&nbsp;optimises&nbsp;the old google search element!</span></p><h4><span data-contrast=auto>Can you tell us a little about your track, ‘You Want Me</span>&nbsp;To&nbsp;Be Art’?<span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p>This is what&nbsp;Eloïse&nbsp;says:<span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>“It’s about the pressures on women to be a lot of contradictory things. I wanted to make fun of that Cosmo magazine and 80s beauty pageant ideal of what being a woman is. I like that it’s feisty but also kind of neurotic, it captures that contradiction.”&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>We worked on this tune together last year and felt it needed to go on the EP. I found an old country tune acapella intro that I loved and chopped it up to oblivion so the original lyrics almost have a completely different sentiment now.</span></p><h4><span data-contrast=auto>What was it like working with Eloise on the single?</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p>I’ve worked with Eloise loads in the past producing her single&nbsp;<span data-contrast=auto>‘Now He Wears White’</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>‘Studio 54’, as well as her first EP. Her lyrical palette is always so evocative, with the references both pithy and full of weight and meaning.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>Her sound is so effortless and she owns an enviable amount of faux animal print clothes.</span><br><span data-ccp-props={>This</span>track is from your upcoming fourth&nbsp;EP ,&nbsp;‘Decades Dream’. What else can we expect from the project?<span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>There is a second EP coming later in the year, a remix from London producer Peter Ibbetson and a few live shows in France (plus possibly a London launch).?There’s&nbsp;also a few cool collaborations coming later in the year.?</span></p><h4><span data-contrast=auto>We understand you’re also a family man. What’s it like balancing the two?</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span data-contrast=auto>Balancing babies and music&nbsp;is&nbsp;tough but rewarding…. I managed to smash&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>two</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;laptop screens in a week last year due to multi-tasking</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>– mixing vocals with one eye on Peppa Pig caused some extensive damage…. twice. (I’ve learnt my lesson).</span></p><h4>Did you have any other aspirations or was it always music?<span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p>I had a notebook when I was 13 listing my heroes and aspirational figures in my life. That list read ‘Gary Lineker, Steve Davis, Ro<span data-contrast=auto>ald</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;Dahl’. Ironically, the same Steve Davis now&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>DJs and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>promotes some of the most exciting new music in the UK… so in a weird kind of way I’ve gone full circle.</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>And of course, I still love Lineker.</span></p><h4>How did you get into music producing?<span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span data-contrast=auto>I’ve been a session musician in London for about 15 years now playing with loads of different musicians. Making my own music has always been a big part of what I do, and I was releasing more&nbsp;jazz based&nbsp;music around 10 years ago. Gradually, I built up a studio and started working with other artists.</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>There seems to be a blurred line of what really defines a producer these days. But I guess creating music or being involved in that process in some way is what’s important to me.</span></p><h4><span data-contrast=auto>Can we expect more collaborations this year?</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p>Yeah, this year I’m planning to collaborate on a track with an artist based in Paris called Beki Mari. There’ll be more tracks out with Amelka May as well as some other new artists. I’m also working on some music with amazing vocalist NYM who releases her first track in May. We’ll be launching a live show with NYM soon too.<span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>I’m also producing some music for a singer-songwriter called Frances Lea. She’s great, sounds somewhere between Animal Collective and Laura Marling!</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span>I’m on tour a bit with other artists over&nbsp;<span data-contrast=auto>the&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>summer and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>at&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>the end of the year. I’ll be doing some gigs with Jamie Cullum, Friendly Fires and a tour with Aussie comic Tim Minchin. Plus a couple of other exciting writing projects.</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span>However, my main focus for the year is Harlequiin.</p><h4><span data-contrast=auto>If you were to skip five years, where do you see yourself?</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></h4><p>I’m hoping in five years that I’ll be working on some more collaborations with Harlequiin, my favourite experience of touring has been small town US club tours with other artists. If I was doing those sorts of shows with Harlequiin&nbsp;<span data-contrast=auto>over</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;the next five years I’d be delighted. 9:30 in Washington, House Of Blues in Boston, Roxy in LA. Such fun towns and venues to play.</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>I’d also love to play some shows in South</span><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;America and generally build the live show.</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=auto>Hopefully in 5 years time I’ll be some sort of suburban dad that’s still allowed to fill my studio with synths and other toys….</span><span data-ccp-props={>&nbsp;</span></p><h4>You can listen to Decade’s Dream here:</h4><h4>What did you think of Harlequiin’s latest track?
