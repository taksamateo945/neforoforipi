Despite this and her massive social media following, she has still managed to maintain a private life, revealing only a little about herself.</span></p><h3><b><strong>Nicole Covone</strong>’s Bio</b></h3><ul><li><span><strong>AGE:</strong> 33 years old</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> 25 April 1990</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> &nbsp;Chicago, Illinois, United States</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTH SIGN</strong>: Taurus&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:&nbsp;</strong>Italian</li><li><span><strong>MOTHER:</strong> Diana Covone</span></li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Nicole Covone?</strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nicole Covone is 33 years old as of 20[“20000101”]. She was born on April 25, 1990, in Chicago, Illinois, United States, and is of American nationality and Italian ethnicity. She was also raised in the United States.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The only member of her family that is known is her mother, Diana Covone, with whom she was very close until 2013 when she lost her. Details about her family members and the kind of childhood she had are all not available to the public. This is because she has always maintained a very private lifestyle.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She Met Lil Durk When She Was Still Very Young</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The love story between Nicole Covone and Lil Durk began when they first met as teenagers. Their paths crossed for the first time in 2008, and at the time, Lil Durk was only 16 years old while Covone was 18. While it remains unclear the circumstances under which they first met, it is no secret that they started a relationship that same year that they met.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At the time, Lil Durk, born on October 19, 1992, was still an aspiring rapper and pretty much unknown. In fact, it was a year after they met that he fully had his start in the American music scene. By 2010, he had his breakthrough following the release of his songs “Sneak Dissin'” and “I’m a Hitta.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There have been claims that, at some point, Nicole and Lik Durk got married, but there is hardly anything to back this up. There are no official records or even dates to show that they were officially declared man and wife. Still, the reports have persisted for some years, with some claiming that they married in a secret event that was only attended by family members and close friends.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some sources claimed they tied the knot sometime in 2011, but this has not been verified.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nicole Covone and Lil Durk Have 2 Kids Together</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The relationship between Lil Durk and Nicole Covone produced two kids, Angelo Banks and Bella Banks, before it ended. Their first child is Angelo Banks, who was born on November 29, 2011, in the United States and is now 12 years old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Two years after the birth of Angelo, Nikky and Lil Durk welcomed a second child named Bella Banks. The girl was born on July 19, 2013, which means she is now 10 years old.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angelo and Bella are American citizens of mixed Italian and African-American ethnicity. The kids have spent much of their childhood with their mom following the breakup between their parents, but their father has also been very much involved in their lives.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The educational pursuits of Nicole’s kids are not known, but they are already popular on social media. While Angelo, who is referred to as Lil Lil Durkiooo on Instagram, has over 1,500 followers, Bella, also known as Queen B, has more than a hundred and ten thousand. The 10-years-old is also an entrepreneur, just like her mother.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Led To Nicole’s Divorce From Lil Durk?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Five years after Lil Durk and Nicole started their relationship, they called it quits in 2013 due to infidelity on the part of Lil Durk. This means the pair divorced only two years after allegedly getting married.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although they seemed to have some marital issues, what triggered the divorce was the fact that Lil Durk impregnated another woman who gave birth to his third child, Zayden Banks, only a few months after Bella Banks was born. This became the deal breaker for Nicole, who decided to walk away from the union.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Details regarding the divorce settlement and custody decision were kept private by the couple. However, as indicated, they both got fully involved in their kids’ lives.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Since going their separate ways, Lil Durk and Covone have managed to deal with their issues privately until 2016, when Banks, who has a total of 6 children with different women, indicated his desire to have custody of&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><span data-preserver-spaces=true>all his kids</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;(Angelo, Bella, Zayden Banks, Du’mier Banks, Skyler Banks, and Willow Banks).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Covone did not hold back in letting the rapper know she was not in tune with him. According to her, raising kids was more than just spending money on them, adding that it also required patience, dedication, and sacrifice. As it stands, Nicole Covone still has custody of their kids and&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lil Durk</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;still has access to them.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lil Durk’s Ex-wife Is A Model and Entrepreneur</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Covone is more than just the former wife of Lil Durk, as she is also an Instagram model, a social media influencer, and an entrepreneur. As an Instagram model and influencer, she has nearly three hundred thousand followers on the platform.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Regarding her career as a businesswoman, Nicole is behind the credit restoration company, The Credit Clique.
